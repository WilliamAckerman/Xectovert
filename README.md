## 3. Usage:
By using Xectovert, one can type in a number they wish to convert to either octal or hexadecimal format, depending on which radio button is currently clicked. When a number has been typed in and a format has been selected, the user can click the "CONVERT" button to see the result of their conversion.

### 3.1 Converting to Octal:
To convert a number to octal format, type a number into the number input field. Then, ensure the radio button to convert to octal format is currently checked. If it is not checked, click the button in order to check it. The radio button to convert a number to octal format is checked by default. When you have typed a number into the number input field and have the radio button to convert to octal format checked, click the "CONVERT" button to see the result of the conversion.

### 3.2 Converting to Hexadecimal:
To convert a number to hexadecimal format, type a number into the number input field. Then, ensure the radio button to convert to hexadecimal is currently checked. If it is not checked, click the button in order to check it. When you have typed a number into the number input field and have the radio button to convert to hexadecimal format checked, click the "CONVERT" button to see the result of the conversion.
